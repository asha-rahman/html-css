            <p>Opera refers to a dramatic art form, originating in 
            Europe, in which the emotional content is conveyed to 
            the audience as much through music, both vocal and ins
            trumental, as it is through the lyrics. By contrast, in
            musical theater an actor's dramatic performance is primary,
            and the music plays a lesser role. </p>
